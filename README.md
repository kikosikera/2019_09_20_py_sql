Business Insights with SQL and Python

 

SQL and Python languages will be accessed to manage data into a DB Server, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata into Pandas.

Data will be queried according to segmentation and demographics goals using built-in database functions, subsequently providing valuable business insights.
